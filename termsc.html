          <hr>
          <p class="mb-0">Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of this website, including any related calls texts or other communications, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. This includes claims against our clients, vendors, and Marketing Partners, which are third party beneficiaries, of the arbitration agreement. The Federal Arbitration Act and Federal Arbitration law apply to this agreement.

            There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these terms as a court would.
            
            The arbitration may be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
            
            We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
